Scenario 1: Create a new customer through the Odoo API

Send a POST request to the /api/v1/customers endpoint 
with the necessary customer information, such as name, email, phone number, and address.
Verify that the response status code is 201 Created.
Retrieve the newly created customer using the GET 
request to the /api/v1/customers/:id endpoint and verify that 
the returned customer information matches the original input.
